# TypeAdventurer
A simple RPG-like game i developed in high-school.

## Software used for this project
- Visual Studio Code version: 1.77.0
- Compiler: gcc (MinGW.org GCC-6.3.0-1) 6.3.0

## About the game
This is the my first game created in the Windows console. I spent about two weeks on it's full development and all the changes I made along the way. It is like the Pokemon RPG games, but much simpler. There are few mechanics like moving, attacking, healing and using a lucky wheel.

## How to play the game
### 1. [Install](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) Visual Studio Code for Windows 10 and the [GCC Compiler](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/)(Windows 10 is necessary)
### 2. Put all 4 files inside the same folder
### 3. Compile `TypeAdventurer.cpp` and then run `TypeAdventurer.exe` that was created in the folder

## Mechanics:
- **Free mode**: You are the smiley face, use WASD to move, ! is your enemy, % is the wheel of fortune (which you may or may not spin) and ? is a surprise. Go to ! or ? to enter the *Battle Mode*;
- **Battle mode**: Choose the action you would like to do by typing the right number. Your Ultimate attack has a cooldown, you have limited mana (mana is used for healing) and health, win fights to earn prizes that boost your stats, wining a ? battle gives you a special prize;
- **Wheel of fortune**: Gives you a random effect, either positive or negative, that will apply on your next battle.
